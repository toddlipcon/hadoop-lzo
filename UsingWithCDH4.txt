While this package should work with any distribution of Hadoop, here
we document the steps involved in getting it to work on CDH4.x

Requirements:
============

1. CDH4.x 
2. Oracle Java: 1.6.0.31 <= version < 1.7.x
3. ant > 1.8.x
4. liblzo2-dev (debian) / liblzo-devel (redhat) / lzp lzo2 (mac)

Building the package:
====================
ant package

Setting up CDH to use lzo
=========================
1. Copy build/hadoop-lzo-*.jar to the hadoop-libs directory 
   (/usr/lib/hadoop/lib/ for default CDH4 installation)
2. Copy build/native/Linux-*-*/lib/libgplcompression.* to hadoop-native-libs directory
   (/usr/lib/hadoop/lib/native for default CDH4 installation)
